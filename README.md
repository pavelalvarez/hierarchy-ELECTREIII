H-electreIII is the well-know ELECTRE III method, but extended for the multiple criteria hierarchy process (MCHP). It allow to aggregate the preference information and generate ranking of alternatives in any node of a hicerchy of criteria.

# hierarchy-ELECTREIII
The extended ELECTRE III method for the multiple criteria hierarchy process (MCHP).

How to run?
- ./H-ELECTRE-III-share <directory_with_input_files>
- ./H-ELECTRE-III-share my_project_name


## Description of the input and output data

> The input files shoul be saved in a directory inside the /projects

Example

projects/my_project_name

Running as
./H-ELECTRE-III-share my_project_name

## Output 
- It is a valued outranking matrix and ranking for each node in the hierarchy.
- If tred package is instaled, the program will import the corresponing graph to .png files.
